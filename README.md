<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

TikTok Trend Analyzer is an undergraduate capstone project  for CIS*4900 at the University of Guelph, set to be completed by August 10, 2024. This project invovles the development of a machine learning model to identify and predict TikTok trends. After the model has been trained, a user-friendly web application will allow users to search and filter trends by time and category. This project is developed by Sulakshan Sivakumaran and Puneet Sandher, both who have limited experience with machine learning and this project is considered a learning experience. 


This repository includes the entire development process including data preprocessing, model training, model finetuning, evaluating models and created graphs, and the final report.
